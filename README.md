Web Based Game using NodeJS, Mongo, Socket.io

This Game is the baseline for SimpulNode - A Framework for Developing Apps quickly!

This system is based on the concept that system routes, websockets and actions should be drop and play.

Basically, drop in a Controller or Model into the App Folder.

Controllers

Controllers accept 3 different values that should be placed into exports for auto loading.
